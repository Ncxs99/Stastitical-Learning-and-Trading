## Regression

This section is dedicated to deep learning projects focused on **regression tasks**, utilizing both the **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow** frameworks. Regression is a core machine learning application where the objective is to predict continuous values based on patterns learned from data, making it essential in fields like finance, healthcare, and engineering.

### Key Areas of Focus:

#### Project Implementation:
Dive into a range of regression projects across various domains, such as predicting house prices, forecasting stock trends, and modeling environmental data. We’ll showcase how to build and train neural networks in both **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow** to accurately predict continuous outputs, adapting the workflows and syntax of each framework to bring out their unique strengths.

#### Metrics and Evaluation:
Evaluating regression models requires specialized metrics tailored to continuous predictions. This section covers key metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and the **R² score**, providing detailed guidance on how to evaluate model accuracy and ensure robustness across training and test data.

#### Model Optimization:
Learn essential techniques for improving model accuracy and generalization in regression tasks. Topics include **hyperparameter tuning**, **regularization** (like L2 regularization), and strategies to combat overfitting and underfitting. We’ll also explore data preprocessing steps such as **feature scaling** and **normalization**, offering best practices for both PyTorch and TensorFlow.

#### Advanced Architectures:
Explore deep learning architectures specifically suited for regression, such as **Fully Connected Networks (FCNs)** and **hybrid models** combining different types of layers to capture complex relationships in data. We’ll demonstrate how to adapt advanced techniques, like attention mechanisms, within both PyTorch and TensorFlow, allowing for richer, more versatile models.

#### Practical Considerations:
Understand the real-world considerations involved in deploying regression models. We’ll discuss handling variability in data, optimizing computational efficiency, and ensuring model interpretability for real-time or production environments. This section will also explore strategies for integrating these models into larger systems, ensuring robustness and scalability.
