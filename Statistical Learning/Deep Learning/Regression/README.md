## Regression

This section is dedicated to deep learning projects focused on **regression tasks** using the PyTorch framework. Regression is a fundamental application of machine learning where the goal is to predict continuous values based on learned patterns in the data, making it highly applicable in fields like finance, healthcare, and engineering.

### Key Areas of Focus:

#### Project Implementation:
Explore a variety of regression projects across different domains, such as predicting stock prices, analyzing medical data, and estimating real estate values. We’ll demonstrate how to build and train neural networks in PyTorch to accurately predict continuous outcomes based on various types of input data.

#### Metrics and Evaluation:
Evaluating regression models requires specific metrics, different from those used in classification. This section will cover key metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score, providing guidance on how to assess model performance and ensure that it generalizes well to unseen data.

#### Model Optimization:
Learn techniques for improving model accuracy and generalization in regression tasks. This includes hyperparameter tuning, regularization methods (like L2 regularization), and strategies to address overfitting and underfitting. We’ll also discuss best practices for data preprocessing and feature scaling to improve model performance.

#### Advanced Architectures:
Explore advanced neural network architectures suited for regression, such as Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) and hybrid models that combine different types of layers for handling complex relationships in the data. You’ll also see how to adapt certain deep learning techniques, like attention mechanisms, to regression problems.

#### Practical Considerations:
Gain insights into deploying regression models in real-world scenarios, handling data variability, and optimizing computational efficiency. We’ll discuss practical aspects like model interpretability, error analysis, and adapting models to dynamic, real-time data.
