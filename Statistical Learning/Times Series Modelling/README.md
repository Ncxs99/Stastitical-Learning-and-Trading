### Time Series Modeling

This section is focused on the traditional statistical modeling of time series data using Python. Here, we explore various classical techniques that do not rely on machine learning but instead utilize well-established statistical methods to analyze and predict time series.

#### Key Areas of Focus:

- **Classical Statistical Models:**
  - **ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average):** Modeling the time series based on its own past values (autoregression) and past errors (moving average).
  - **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** Extending ARMA by incorporating differencing to make the time series stationary.
  - **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA):** Addressing seasonality in time series data by incorporating seasonal differencing and seasonal autoregressive/moving average terms.
  - **ARIMAX (ARIMA with Exogenous Regressors):** Enhancing ARIMA by including external variables that can influence the time series.
  - **SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with Exogenous Regressors):** Combining SARIMA with exogenous variables to improve the model's predictive power.

#### Objectives:

- **Simple and Effective Modeling:**
  - Demonstrating how to use basic Python functions and libraries to model and predict time series data without the need for complex machine learning algorithms.
  
- **Hands-On Examples:**
  - Providing practical examples and tutorials that guide users through the process of applying these statistical models to real-world time series data.

- **Versatile Applications:**
  - Showcasing the versatility of these methods across various types of time series, from economic indicators to environmental data, illustrating how classical statistical models can still offer powerful insights and accurate predictions.

This section is ideal for those looking to understand the fundamentals of time series analysis and prediction using traditional statistical methods in Python, offering a solid foundation before venturing into more complex machine learning techniques.
