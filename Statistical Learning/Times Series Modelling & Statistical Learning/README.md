### Time Series Modeling and Statistical Learning

This section is dedicated to the exploration and application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for time series modeling. Our focus is on leveraging advanced methods to tackle a wide range of time series data, not limited to financial datasets, in order to demonstrate the power and versatility of these approaches.

#### Key Objectives:

- **Machine Learning for Time Series:**
  - Applying classical machine learning techniques such as classification and regression models to analyze and predict time series data.
  
- **Deep Learning for Time Series:**
  - Utilizing deep learning models, including RNNs, LSTMs, and other neural network architectures, to capture complex temporal patterns and enhance predictive capabilities.

- **Diverse Applications:**
  - While the section is open to modeling any type of time series, the goal is to highlight the effectiveness of these methods across various domains. For example, our current project involves **Bitcoin Price Prediction**, where we apply these techniques to forecast cryptocurrency prices.

This section serves as a comprehensive resource for data scientists, researchers, and practitioners interested in applying machine learning and deep learning to time series data, offering insights and practical examples that demonstrate the strength of these methods in real-world scenarios.
