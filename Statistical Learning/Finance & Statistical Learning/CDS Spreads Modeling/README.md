### CDS Spread Modeling

This section is dedicated to the time series modeling of Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads across various companies. It includes two specific notebooks that explore different approaches to understanding and predicting CDS spreads using a combination of traditional time series methods and advanced machine learning techniques.

#### Notebooks Overview:

1. **CDS Spread Time Series Modeling (Part I):**
   - In this notebook, we focus on modeling CDS spreads using traditional time series methods such as ARMA and ARIMA models.
   - Key steps include:
     - **Stationarity Analysis:** Assessing whether the CDS spreads are stationary and suitable for time series modeling.
     - **Model Fitting:** Evaluating the goodness-of-fit for ARMA and ARIMA models.
     - **Volatility Modeling:** Applying GARCH models to capture the volatility clustering often observed in financial time series.

2. **CDS Spread Time Series Modeling (Part II):**
   - This notebook builds upon the first by extending the analysis to multiple time series, specifically the joint evolution of CDS spreads for LITRAX and Renault.
   - Key components include:
     - **Cointegration Analysis:** Investigating the long-term relationship and co-movement between DJ-ITRAXX and Renault CDS spreads.
     - **Multivariate ARMA Models:** Utilizing multidimensional ARMA models to capture the joint dynamics of the CDS spreads.
     - **Deep Learning Models:** Implementing models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to leverage deep learning techniques for predicting CDS spreads.

#### Focus Areas:

- **Time Series Analysis:** Deep dive into traditional and modern time series methodologies for financial data.
- **Multivariate Modeling:** Exploring the interactions between multiple CDS spreads and their collective behavior.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Combining statistical learning with machine learning approaches to enhance predictive accuracy and model robustness.

This section provides a comprehensive toolkit for financial analysts, quants, and researchers who are interested in advanced time series modeling of CDS spreads, blending statistical methods with cutting-edge machine learning techniques.
